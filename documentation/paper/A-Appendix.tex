\subsection{Download and installation instructions}
The source code for the translator can be downloaded by checking out the project's git repository.
Take care to either \texttt{git clone} the repository with the option flag \texttt{--recursive}, or to run the command
\begin{lstlisting}
	git submodule update --init
\end{lstlisting}
as the repository contains submodules that are required for compilation.

Then, the translator can be built by exeucting
\begin{lstlisting}
	sudo apt-get -y install gcc g++ cmake make autoconf meson
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
			-DCMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION=true ..
	make
\end{lstlisting}
in the root directory of the repository.
Note that the build requires CMake version 3.15 or above.
This will build two artifacts:
\begin{description}
	\item[translator] The dynamic binary translator.
	For details on the usage, see section~\ref{sec:translator-usage}, or execute \texttt{./translator -h}.
	
	\item[test] The unit test binary.
	It can be executed via \texttt{./test} and performs extensive unit testing of the RISC--V instruction implementations, the cache, register file, as well as the parser.
\end{description}

\subsection{Executable program requirements}
We can execute binaries compiled via the tools provided in the RISC--V GNU toolchain\footnote{For further information as well as download and usage instructions, see \url{https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain} (last accessed on 25.09.2020).}.
The executables need to be linked statically (pass the flag \texttt{-static} to GCC when compiling), as the translator does not support dynamically linked files.

We currently support binaries compiled for the architecture specifier \texttt{rv64imafd} (also called \texttt{rv64g}), meaning the compiler is free to utilise the base integer instruction set (\texttt{i}), as well as the instructions provided by the multiplication (\texttt{m}), atomic (\texttt{a}) and floating point standard extensions (\texttt{f}, \texttt{d}).
This can be achieved by passing \texttt{--march=rv64g} to GCC\footnote{Note that some architecture strings require recompilation of the toolchain. Also, excluding the floating point instructions in the architecture string implies \texttt{-mabi=lp64}.}.


\subsection{Using the translator}
\label{sec:translator-usage}
\begin{lstlisting}
	./translator [translator option(s)] -f <filename> [guest options]
\end{lstlisting}

Seen above is the syntax for executing the translator with a guest program.
All possible translator options are described in the help text, as seen by executing \texttt{./translator -h}.
Every option after the filename specified via the \texttt{-f} flag is passed along to the guest in its \texttt{argv}, so all options intended for the translator must be passed before \texttt{-f}.

The command line options also include the ability to analyse (\texttt{-a}) the binary to produce a detailed breakdown of which instruction mnemonics and registers the guest will use when executed.
Furthermore, it includes the ability to time the execution of only the guest program (\texttt{-b}) and profile the register and cache usage (\texttt{-p}).

Logging can be controlled by passing the requested category to the \texttt{----log} flag as detailed in the help, and can provide insights into the state of the translator during execution or debugging.
Lastly, it is also possible to selectively disarm optimisation features like the return address stack, block chaining, recursive jump target translation or macro operation fusion via \texttt{----optimize}.

\subsection{Performance testing of floating point translations}
Similarly to the proceedings laid out in section \ref{subsec:spec-cpu-2017-benchmark-suite}, we also tested the performance of the F- and D-extension translations by using the \texttt{fpspeed} suite of \textit{SPEC CPU 2017}.

\begin{itemize*}
 	\item fix an issue with the \texttt{read} system call that causes blocking problems with gzip
\end{itemize*}


\paragraph{Version 1.0}
The initial release of the translator capable of executing gzip.

This release supports

 	\item the multiplication extension instructions (M)
 	\item the atomic extension instructions (A).
\end{itemize*}

The latter are not yet implemented atomically, however they make the translator compatible with binaries compiled for the architecture \texttt{rv64ima}, with the ABI \texttt{lp64}.
