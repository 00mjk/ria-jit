The following section aims to provide an in-depth overview of the system's architecture as well as the rationale for major design decisions taken during the implementation.

\subsection{System architecture and execution control flow}
% todo overview, add class diagrams and flow charts

\subsection{Instruction translation process}
% todo

\subsection{Code cache and TLB for block lookup}
% todo

\subsection{Static hybrid register mapping}
% todo register mapping details

\subsection{Optimisation of the generated code}
\subsubsection{Block chaining}
\subsubsection{Recursive jump translation}
% todo optimisation details, maybe split up?

\subsection{System call handling overview}
% todo add an overview table for the system calls handled
% todo special description for emulated calls
