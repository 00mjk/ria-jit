Measuring the performance of the DBT was accomplished by using the tools in \textit{SPEC CPU 2017}'s \texttt{intspeed} suite of benchmarks.
This not only generates reproducible and widely accepted results in the industry, it also validates the results produced during the run, thus ruling out any errors in the benchmark's translation.

The \texttt{intspeed} suite also presents a variety of different workloads to the translator that are based on real-life scenarios, thus producing an accurate and understandable overview of the DBT's performance in a non-controlled environment.
