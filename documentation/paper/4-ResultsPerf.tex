Measuring the performance of the DBT was accomplished by using the tools in \textit{SPEC CPU 2017}'s \texttt{intspeed} suite of benchmarks.
This not only generates reproducible and widely accepted results in the industry, it also validates the results produced during the run, thus ruling out any errors in the benchmark's translation.

% todo include benchmark description table (and list of tables) for the spec programs with the benchmark workload description
The \texttt{intspeed} suite also presents a variety of different workloads to the translator that are based on real-life scenarios, thus producing an accurate and understandable overview of the DBT's performance in a non-controlled environment.
Further context is provided by performance testing using the data compression utility gzip, where compression time is compared between runs on a native machine, in QEMU and in the DBT.
