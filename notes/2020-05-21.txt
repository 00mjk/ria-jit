- register allocation:
======================
    - maybe store amount of temp registers
    - definitely make rax, rcx (for shifts), rdx (for division) available
    - create priority order of registers?
    - count the number of instructions in the basic block, if it's below a certain threshold: don't allocate registers
        (-> only caller saved then)

- work allocation:
==================
    - translate_controlflow: Johannes
    - translate_arithmetic: finish by Flo
    - translate_m_ext: Flo
    - translate_csr: ? (for later!)
    - translate_loadstore: Simon
    - translate_other: Noah (including syscalls! -> don't translate every single one yetâ€¦) https://github.com/aengelke/instrew/blob/master/client/emulate.c
    - stack allocation: Simon
    - testing program compiled for RISC-V: Simon
    - check in ELF parsing for RISC extensions
    - (unit) testing? (--> Boost framework for C++, --> GitHub google/googletest)
    - Angebot!
