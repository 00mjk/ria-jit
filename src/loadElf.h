 * after parsing the arguments in main we could exchange the pointer to '--' with the filename pointer. optind should
 * then be the index of the first guest program argument so this should be easy. Although getopt() will probably not
 * work with -nostdlib, so we will have to write our own implementation... This bracketed bit is just an impl note
