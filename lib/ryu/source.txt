This "library" is adapted from https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu (commit ea700fa) which is available under
LICENSE-Apache2, LICENSE-Boost licenses.
The following changes were made:
1) Completely got rid of stdlib usage and replaced that functionality with our minilib
2) Removed not needed methods and files
3) Renamed common.h to ryucommon.h to prevent clash with our minilib header.
